## 📫 • General:

 - Plugin Introduction: 

   > This is a very simple plugin and at the same time almost totally configurable, with it you can compact ores and turn them into blocks, helping to save space in your inventory, this plugin is very well known on several servers, as no one had done publicly yet, I decided to do, i hope you like!
 
 - Plugin Features:

   > This plugin is subdivided into features by category! All categories:
   > **[General](https://github.com/Henry12960/Compact)**, 
   > **[Compact Blocks](https://github.com/Henry12960/Compact)**,
   > **[Ores ID](https://github.com/Henry12960/Compact)**,
   > **[Blocks ID](https://github.com/Henry12960/Compact)**.

 - Suggestions:

   > Avoid repeat world's names in config.yml, this can cause error!

   > Avoid putting wrong blocks and item id in config.yml and also wrong configuration with ```min-ores-compact``` and ```blocks-give-compact```

## 👷‍♂️ • Todo

   > If you want to add money to compress the blocks, use this api, it will be implemented in the plugin soon:

# Add money

use davidglitch04\libEco\libEco;
libEco::addMoney($player, $amount);

# Remove money

use davidglitch04\libEco\libEco;
libEco::reduceMoney($player, $amount, static function(bool $success) : void {
});
```
